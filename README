This plugin allows you to index one of the most popular formats 
for Windows help files, manuals and ebooks. Plugin source code is 
available from trivex.net.

all of the individual HTML pages contained inside as text.

To install, follow these instructions:
   1. Run the "LarrysHelpFileIndexer.exe" file in the zip.
   2. Agree to the registration with Google Desktop Search.
   3. You're done! Your system will now be indexing CHM files.

To uninstall, follow these instructions:

   1. Go to your Start menu and select "Control Panel".
   2. Select "Add/Remove Programs"
   3. Find "Larry's Help File Indexer" and click "Remove".
   4. Thats it!
